# EIE-simulator
C++ RTL simulator for EIE(https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01528)

Traditional Verilog simulator is too slow to run full-layer simulations. 
This C++ simulator can simulate an FC layer in seconds, enables us to estimate number of cycles for different models/layers.
For power/area estimation, we still use Verilog simulation.
